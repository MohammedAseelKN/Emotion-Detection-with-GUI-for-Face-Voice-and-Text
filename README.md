# Emotion-Detection-with-GUI-for-Face-Voice-and-Text
This project focuses on building a multi-modal emotion detection system with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Gradio. It analyzes emotions from three sources: facial expressions (via DeepFace), voice recordings (via Librosa and audio features), and text inputs (via transformer models like DistilBERT).
